\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Our problem is to \textbf{predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke} based on
the input parameters such as age, diseases, smoking status and so.

We have chosen this problem because being able to predict stroke could prevent thousands of death per year since stroke is the second  cause of death in developed countries \cite{who}.

\section{The dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}

The dataset is from \href{https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset}{Keggle}. The source is \textbf{confidential} since it contains personal data of patients of various hospitals.

The dataset is composed by:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 12 variables (7 numerical, 5 categorical)
  \item 5110 samples
  \item Only attribute \textit{bmi} has missing values.
  \item Some attributes have outliers e.g. \textit{age} and \textit{bmi}
  \item The dataset is imbalanced ($95$ --- $5$). We need to take this into consideration when doing the analysis.
\end{itemize}
